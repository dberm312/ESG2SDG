# ESG2SDG
Used this code to find how closely aligned written reports are to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals

Using Natural Language Processing techniques such as Word2Vec and BERT, this programme scrapes through publicly available reports (such as annual reports, press releases, or disclosures to regulators), to see how sustainability reporting aligns with environmental themes identified by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
